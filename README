flickr tricklr... a simple perl script to upload a random photo from a
directory to your photo stream.

the intent of this project is to provide a tool to schedule updates to your
photo stream, to garner more interest in your work... if you upload 200
pictures at once, you get less views, etc.

also, this will spread the photos out, so you don't have (theoretically)
4 photos of the same waterfall right next to each other in your stream, etc

meant to be run from cron at a set time of day to upload a random selection
of photos from a provided pool.
